Raspberry Pi NAS **Aria2** Download magnetic link no speed

Download Aria2 and install it. I recommend installing the web ui as well, so you can set up your router from your pc. Here are the links:

``` url

```

If the download speed is always 0 after adding the target magnetic link

Add the address of the BT Tracker server,

Google BT Tracker server will find out a lot, in my experience GitHub is often updated, many servers on other sites may not be maintained.

system setting》BitTorrent setting》BT Service，Just enter the BTtracker address as a comma. 

Done!!
