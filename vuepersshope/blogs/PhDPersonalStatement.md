# PhD Personal Statement

I have 7 years of experience working with C#. Since I graduated from medical school, I have been working in hospital related industry. Helped hospitals to do the management system of drugs, and used RFID chips to do the whole life cycle tracking of medical consumables and medical devices. During this time have done path navigation algorithms for logistics AVG carts and have worked on sound feature extraction in equipment failure warning systems.

I have worked with different communication protocols such as RS232, CAN Bus, USB HID, Socket API, and RESTful API to interface with various sensors and third-party systems. I have even written my own communication protocols to add user bytes between data frames and data length frames for synchronizing the operation of the upper and lower unit computers.

I have worked with different sensors such as face recognition, finger vein recognition, temperature and humidity sensors, vibration sensors, and sound sensors. I have even used the GY-MPU9250 (a type of IMU) to detect the vibration of the drive motor to determine the wear and tear of the motor.

Last year I came to TUS to study and achieved a 1:1 first-class honor in the course. During that time, I considered doing a VR graduate program but never found a suitable project until I heard about this project on Gait analysis. This project interested me very much, and it had a lot in common with my previous experience. I think it is a project that is relatively easy to commercialize and helps patients and doctors a lot. I think with my background and ability I should be able to make something different.
